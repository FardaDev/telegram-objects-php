### Test Driven Design

- **Write tests first** for any new code or feature.  
- Implement the code to make the tests pass.  
- **Run the tests** immediately after writing the code.  
- If tests fail, **fix the code** until all tests pass.  
- Ensure tests cover **expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions**.
- when a task is done do not forget to mark is as complete in tasks.md in specs
