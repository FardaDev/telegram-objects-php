# Internal Development Documentation

This folder contains internal documentation and guides for maintainers and contributors.

## Contents

### Guides

- **CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md** - How to maintain the CHANGELOG.md file
- **DEPENDABOT_GUIDE.md** - Understanding and managing Dependabot PRs

## Purpose

These documents are kept for reference but are not part of the public-facing documentation. They help maintainers understand internal processes and standards.

## For Contributors

If you're contributing to this project, these guides will help you understand:
- How we track changes
- How we manage dependencies

For attribution standards, see `docs/attribution-template.md` (kept in main docs for consistency).

## Note

These files are tracked in git but excluded from Packagist distribution via `.gitattributes`.
